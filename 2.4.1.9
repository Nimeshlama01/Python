#Variables to define the value for kilometers and miles
kilometers = 12.25 
miles = 7.38

#Variables to define the values after the conversion
miles_to_kilometers = miles * 1.61
kilometers_to_miles = kilometers / 1.61

#Prints miles and kilometers as calculated in the variables above and furlongs as calculated in the Print () function below. 1 mile is approximately 8 Furlongs
