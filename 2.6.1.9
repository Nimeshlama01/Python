#Simple Input and Output

a = float (input("Input value for a: "))# input a float value for variable a here
b = float (input("Input value for b: "))# input a float value for variable b here

print ("Addition of those values: ", a+b)# output the result of addition here
print ("Substraction of those values: ", (-(a-b)*(b-a))**0.5)# output the result of subtraction here which will be always positive regardless of bigger or smaller
print ("Multiplication of those values: ", a*b)# output the result of multiplication here

print ("Division of those values: ", round((a/b), 2))# output the result of division here

print ("a exponent b: ", round((a**b),2)) # Output the result of a to the power of b
print ("Floor division of those values: ", a//b) #Output the result of floor division when a is divided by b 
print("\nThat's all, folks!")
